    "question": "A 5 kg object accelerates at 2 m/s². What is the net force acting on the object?",
    "solution": "Solution:\nUsing Newton's Second Law: Force = mass × acceleration\nF = 5 kg × 2 m/s² = 10 N\n\nAnswer: 10 N",

    "question": "A 2 kg object is moving at 5 m/s. What is its kinetic energy?",
    "solution": "Solution:\nUsing the formula: Kinetic Energy = ½ × mass × velocity²\nKE = ½ × 2 kg × (5 m/s)²\nKE = ½ × 2 × 25\nKE = 25.00 J\n\nAnswer: 25.00 J",
